                    <h2>Why Does My Cat Bite Me?</h2> 
                    <h4>Kittens often bite when teething or out of curiosity or playfulness, while adult cats are more likely to bite for other reasons.</h4> 
                    
                    <h3><i>Lack of Bite Inhibition</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Kittens learn manners and appropriate play through interactions with their mother and siblings. However, when they are adopted too early, owners must teach these lessons. Even adult cats who missed this training may not understand that their claws and teeth hurt unless shown in a way they understand.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Play</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Cats may bite and scratch when playing with other cats, and they may carry this behavior over to playtime with their humans. Your cat may grab you with their mouth and bite, sometimes painfully. Some cats get caught up in the fun and don't realize they are play-biting too hard. Other times, the cat becomes overly excited and begins to act defensively.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Overstimulation</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Some cats may seem to enjoy petting but suddenly bite or scratch due to overstimulation. This behavior is often caused by the cat's subtle body language signals indicating they no longer want to be petted, which can easily be missed.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Self-Defense and Fear</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Cats may bite to defend themselves when they feel threatened or scared. If biting has been effective in stopping unwanted actions, such as nail trimming, cats may use it again when faced with similar situations.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Redirected Aggression</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Cats may display aggression towards humans when they are upset by something else, like other animals in or outside the home. If you're nearby, the cat may redirect its frustration, biting you instead. For example, a cat may be frustrated by not being able to reach a bird or insect outside.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Attention Seeking</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Some cats bite as a form of communication or demand for attention. Instead of meowing, they bite. If a cat nips you and then tries to lead you to an activity, such as the food bowl or to play with a toy, this could be the reason.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Affection</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Believe it or not, some cats like to give "love bites" to people and don't realize it's a little too hard. When cats bite you affectionately, they'll often lick you as wellâ€”they're like kitty kisses.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <h3><i>Pain or Illness</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Nearly any medical condition can cause pain or discomfort, and some cats will react by biting, especially if they're touched where it hurts.</li> 
                    </ul>
