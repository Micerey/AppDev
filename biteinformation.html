                    <h2>Why Do Dogs Bite?</h2> 
                    <h4>Most often, dogs bite people when they feel threatened in some way. It's a natural instinct that's still present in domesticated dogs. This is why it's important for everyone who interacts with a dog to understand what may provoke this aggressive behavior
                    </h4> 

                    <h3><i>Self Defense and Protection</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Dogs may bite to defend themselves, their territory, or a family member. A mother dog fiercely protects her puppies as well.</li> 
                    </ul> 

                    <h3><i>Startling Situations</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Startling a dog by waking it up or approaching suddenly from behind can lead to a bite.</li>
                    </ul> 

                    <h3><i>Play and Pursuit</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Running away from a dog, even during play, can provoke a bite. The dog may think it's part of the fun, or running away could trigger herding behavior or predatory pursuit in some breeds.</li> 
                    </ul> 

                    <h3><i>Fear-induced bites</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>A dog in a fearful situation may bite anyone who approaches it. This situation may be as severe as being abused or abandoned by the side of the road, or it may be something you perceive as ordinary, such as a loud noise.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3><i>Injury and Illness</i></h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Injury and illness are common reasons as well. If a dog isn't feeling well or is in pain, it may not even want to be approached or touched by its favorite people.</li>
